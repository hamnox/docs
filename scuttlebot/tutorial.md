# Introduction to Using Scuttlebot

This tutorial will help you familiarize with Scuttlebot, so you can build scripts and applications.

Scuttlebot is pretty unusual compared to datastores like MySQL or Redis, so let's get started with some basics.

## What is Scuttlebot?

Scuttlebot is a peer-to-peer log store.
Its data model is similar to that of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), and it's part of a pattern that's now referred to as the [Kappa Architecture](http://kappa-architecture.com/).

What is Kappa Architecture?

 > Kappa Architecture is a software architecture pattern.
 Rather than using a relational DB like SQL or a key-value store like Cassandra, the canonical data store in a Kappa Architecture system is an append-only immutable log.
 From the log, data is streamed through a computational system and fed into auxiliary stores for serving.

So, imagine if Twitter supported JSON posts, and allowed more characters.
Now imagine your JSON-Twitter was also peer-to-peer.

In a nutshell, that's Scuttlebot.

## How do you write applications with it?

While feeds of JSON messages may seem pretty limited, they're actually able to support some pretty complex data-structures.

For instance, imagine we wanted to write a new file-sharing app.
To declare a new "package" of files, we might just publish a message like this:

```js
{
  type: 'create-file-package',
  package: 'My Files Package'
}
```

Then, we could add files with some more messages:

```js
{
  type: 'add-file-to-package',
  package: 'My Files Package',
  name: 'hello-world.txt',
  fileData: 'Hello, world!'
}
{
  type: 'add-file-to-package',
  package: 'My Files Package',
  name: 'my-picture.jpg',
  fileData: fs.readFileSync('./my-picture.jpg').toString('base64')
}
```

And then decide that, no, maybe that picture shouldnt be in the package:

```js
{
  type: 'remove-file-from-package',
  package: 'My Files Package',
  name: 'my-picture.jpg'
}
```

With the right processing code, we could easily scan these messages and produce a predictable output state, in the form of a data-structure:

```js
{
  package: 'My Files Package',
  files: { 'hello-world.txt': 'Hello, world!' }
}
```

And that's exactly how Scuttlebot applications work.
So, let's dig into the practical steps of making that happen.

## Setup the Server

The first step is to [install](./install.html) Scuttlebot.
You'll want the server running on the device that's running your application.

Scuttlebot is meant to be used on users' devices, in a P2P network.
It can be embedded ([Patchwork](https://ssbc.github.io/patchwork/) does this) but that's going to create conflicts after the user installs two Scuttlebot-embedding apps.
So, for now, it's best to tell your users to install and run Scuttlebot or Patchwork themselves, as dependencies to your app.

## Create the Client

The current process for connecting to scuttlebot involves loading the master keypair from sbot's config (~/.ssb/secret).
You can do this automatically with the [ssb-client](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-client) module.

```js
var ssbClient = require('ssb-client')
ssbClient(function (err, sbot) {
  // ready
})
```

NOTE: Scuttlebot's CLI translates directly from the shell to RPC calls.
That means any call you can make programmatically can be made from the shell as well.

## Publishing Messages

Publishing messages in Scuttlebot is very simple:

```js
sbot.publish({ type: type, ... }, cb)
```

Here's an example publish:

```js
sbot.publish({ type: 'post', text: 'hello, world' }, cb)
```

You are free to put anything you want in the message, with the following rules:

 - You must include a `type` attribute.
 - The output message, including headers, cannot exceed 8kb.

You can find [common message-schemas here](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-msg-schemas).
For our toy file-publishing app, we'll make our own message schemas.

Let's create some convenience functions to do the publishing:

```js
function createPackage (sbot, package, cb) {
  sbot.publish({
    type: 'create-file-package',
    package: package
  }, cb)
}

function addFile (sbot, package, name, fileData, cb) {
  sbot.publish({
    type: 'add-file-to-package',
    package: package,
    name: name,
    fileData: fileData
  }, cb)
}

function removeFile (sbot, package, name, cb) {
  sbot.publish({
    type: 'remove-file-from-package',
    package: package,
    name: name
  }, cb)
}
```

Now it's a little easier to create the messages we published earlier:

```js
var pictureBase64 = fs.readFileSync('./my-picture.jpg').toString('base64')
createPackage(sbot, 'My Files Package')
addFile(sbot, 'My Files Package', 'hello-world.txt', 'Hello, world!')
addFile(sbot, 'My Files Package', 'my-picture.jpg', pictureBase64)
removeFile(sbot, 'My Files Package', 'my-picture.jpg')
```

## Attaching Files to Messages

Messages have an 8kb limit, including the headers that are automatically added, so it's not a good idea to try to cram base64-encoded files into them.
Instead, we should use Scuttlebot's blob-store to publish the files, which presently has a 5MB limit.

We'll add another function to do this:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var pull = require('pull-stream') // will explain later
var toPull = require('stream-to-pull-stream')

function addFileFromDisk (sbot, package, name, filePath, cb) {
  // add the file to the local blobstore
  pull(
    toPull.source(fs.createReadStream(filePath)),
    sbot.blobs.add(function (err, fileId) {
      if (err)
        cb(err)
      else {
        // publish
        addFile(sbot, package, name, fileId, cb)
      }
    })
  )
}
```

And we can now use this function to publish our jpg:

```js
addFileFromDisk(sbot, 'My Files Package', 'my-picture.jpg', './my-picture.jpg')
```

The result is something more like this:

```js
{
  type: 'add-file-to-package',
  package: 'My Files Package',
  name: 'my-picture.jpg',
  fileData: '&RRELXJAxum631eq1ikj7+qngd3f6Dvz7eA1mZNHBPQ0=.sha256'
}
```

The value of `fileData` is now a [content-hash link](https://ssbc.github.io/docs/ssb/linking.html).
When other Scuttlebots see it, they'll ask their peers for the blob that matches that sha256 hash.
That means the file will lag behind the message a little bit, but it'll get there eventually!

## Reading the Messages

Now that we've got the publishing handled, we need to read the messages in, and process them into our output state.

Scuttlebot uses [pull-streams](https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream).
In most cases, you'll use them like this:   

```js
pull(sbot.foo(), pull.drain(function (msg) {
  // process the message as it arrive
}, function (err) {
  // stream is over
}))
```

Or, like this

```js
pull(sbot.foo(), pull.collect(function (err, msgs) {
  // process all the messages after the stream ends
}))
```

We'll use them now with [createLogStream](http://ssbc.github.io/docs/api/scuttlebot.html#createlogstream-source) to create a persistent live stream of messages.
As each message is added, either due to network-gossip, or by the local user, it will be emitted here:

```js
pull(sbot.createLogStream({ live: true }), pull.drain(processMsg))
```

## Processing the Messages

Let's create some in-memory data structures to hold onto the file-packages.

It's important to realize, that the order of messages is only preserved within a given user's feed.
If Bob publishes 3 messages in a row, then every user that syncs Bob's feed will get those 3 messages in the same order.
But, if Alice publishes a fourth message, other users will not know if her message came before Bob's 3 messages, after them, or somewhere in the middle.

This can be mitigated with [Content Hash Links](https://ssbc.github.io/docs/ssb/linking.html), which provides a guaranteed "happens before" relationship.
However, that's not enough in our case to allow us to mix the users' packages.
Therefore, we'll separate the packages by user.

Here's how we'll handle `create-file-package` messages:

```js
var packagesByUser = {}

function onCreatePackage (msg) {
  // pull variables out of the message
  var author = msg.value.author
  var package = msg.value.content.package

  // validate the content
  if (!package || typeof package !== 'string')
    return console.log('Warning: malformed message', msg)

  // create the user's entry in the listing, if it does not exist yet
  if (!(author in packagesByUser))
    packagesByUser[author] = {}

  // create the package structure (overwrite if it already existed)
  packagesByUser[author][package] = {
    package: package,
    files: {}
  }
}
```

Notice that `msg.value.content.package` is validated, but `msg.value.author` is not.
Scuttlebot's internal APIs will validate everything in `msg.value.*` except for `msg.value.content.*`.
That's up to the application.

Like incoming HTTP requests, you should always validate the content of the message, as it may be incorrect or harmful.

Let's handle the 'add-file-to-package' message next:

```js
function onAddFile (msg) {
  // pull variables out of the message
  var author = msg.value.author
  var package = msg.value.content.package
  var name = msg.value.content.name
  var fileData = msg.value.content.fileData

  // validate the content
  if (!package || typeof package !== 'string')
    return console.log('Warning: malformed message', msg)
  if (!name || typeof name !== 'string')
    return console.log('Warning: malformed message', msg)
  if (!fileData || typeof fileData !== 'string')
    return console.log('Warning: malformed message', msg)

  // reject if the package doesnt exist yet
  if (!(author in packagesByUser) || !(package in packagesByUser[author]))
    return console.log('Warning: add-file-to-package message published before create-package', msg)

  // update the file entry
  packagesByUser[author][package].files[name] = fileData
}
```

That should be relatively unsurprising.
The remove-file code should also be pretty obvious:

```js
function onRemoveFile (msg) {
  // pull variables out of the message
  var author = msg.value.author
  var package = msg.value.content.package
  var name = msg.value.content.name

  // validate the content
  if (!package || typeof package !== 'string')
    return console.log('Warning: malformed message', msg)
  if (!name || typeof name !== 'string')
    return console.log('Warning: malformed message', msg)

  // reject if the package doesnt exist yet
  if (!(author in packagesByUser) || !(package in packagesByUser[author]))
    return console.log('Warning: add-file-to-package message published before create-package', msg)

  // remove the file entry
  delete packagesByUser[author][package].files[name]
}
```

Now we can tie it together with the processMsg function:

```js
pull(sbot.createLogStream({ live: true }), pull.drain(processMsg))

function processMsg (msg) {
  if (msg.value.content.type == 'create-package')
    onCreatePackage(msg)
  
  if (msg.value.content.type == 'add-file-to-package')
    onAddFile(msg)
  
  if (msg.value.content.type == 'remove-file-from-package')
    onRemoveFile(msg)
}
```

And, there you have it.
Our data-structure will now look like what we expect it to:

```js
// after processing the messages
console.log(packagesByUser) /* => {
  '@hxGxqPrplLjRG2vtjQL87abX4QKqeLgCwQpS730nNwE=.ed25519': {
    'My Files Package': {
      package: 'My Files Package',
      files: { 'hello-world.txt': 'Hello, world!' }
    }
  }
}
```

But, what about those files in the blob-store?

## Reading Files from Messages

The blob-store provides a hash-id when you add a file, which is used to create [Content-Hash Links](https://ssbc.github.io/docs/ssb/linking.html).

When you expect an attribute to be a link, you can handle it with [ssb-msgs](http://ssbc.github.io/docs/api/ssb-msgs.html) link functions.
Let's create a "get file" function to demonstrate it:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var mlib = require('ssb-msgs')
var pull = require('pull-stream')
var toPull = require('stream-to-pull-stream')

function writeFile (sbot, user, package, name, outPath) {
  // find the file
  if (!(user in packagesByUser))
    return cb(new Error('not found'))
  if (!(package in packagesByUser[user]))
    return cb(new Error('not found'))
  if (!(name in packagesByUser[user][package].files))
    return cb(new Error('not found'))

  // handle depending on whether it's a link
  var fileData = packagesByUser[user][package].files[name]
  if (mlib.isLink(fileData, 'blob')) {
    // it is, pull from the blob store
    readFileFromBlobstore(sbot, fileData, outPath, cb)
  } else {
    // it's not, the data was inlined in the message
    fs.writeFile(outPath, fileData, cb)
  }
}
function readFileFromBlobstore (sbot, fileData, outPath, cb) {
  // standardize the link format (links can take many different shapes)
  var fileLink = mlib.link(fileData)

  // get from blobstore and write to disk
  pull(
    sbot.blobs.get(fileLink.link),
    toPull.sink(fs.createWriteStream(outpath), cb)
  )
}
```

And there you have it!
A nice quick way to get your jpg:

```js
writeFile(sbot, userId, 'My Files Package', 'my-picture.jpg', './my-picture.jpg', console.log)
```

## Next Steps

From here, you should read about the [Secure Scuttlebutt protocol](https://ssbc.github.io/secure-scuttlebutt/), and be sure to understand the [Content-Hash Linking](https://ssbc.github.io/docs/ssb/linking.html).
There are Howto Guides and Examples along the left nav.
You can also find detailed API references, and some articles, in the [documentation section](https://ssbc.github.io/docs/).

Happy coding!
